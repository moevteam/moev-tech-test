# MOEV Technical test

This repository contains the skeleton React project you'll need for the MOEV technical test. It's just a basic React application running with Vite.

## Repository setup

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies

Run `npm run dev` to launch the application

## Interview instructions

The next stage of the interview process is a LIVE pair programming exercise, where you will write some simple React code, using an API, some hooks, and building and styling some custom components. Your assessor will be there to assist and guide you during the assessment - think of it as pair programming on a ticket. The purpose of the assessment is to understand your technical ability, as well as get a feel for how you think about and solve problems, whilst working with another engineer.

You will receive a copy of the exercises at the start of the test, but before your test start time, please ensure you have done the following:

- Clone the skeleton code repository
- Ensure that you can run the React project on your machine
- Ensure that your screen sharing, camera, and microphone are all working!

During the test you will be asked to share your screen whilst writing code. We want the experience to be as comfortable for you as possible, so we want you to use the IDE and set up that you are used to!
